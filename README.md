# Database-Management-System
This is a preliminary design for a cafe management database for a school project <br>
The diagrams were reviewed by industry experts (instructors from Boston University), feedback was incorporated into the design process to enhance data storing and retrieval procedures.<br>
After carefully considered structural database rules, I have added Specialization-generalization changes to the Conceptual Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). Here is the resulting ERD that I referenced to create the SQL code. 
Keep in mind that we expect the ERD to continue to grow and evolve significantly, therefore it was designed with low degree of granularity and is highly scalable.
